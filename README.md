# DUIT

I found this code base on my computer, but I actually don't remember
writing it. I do remember designing my own game levels for DOOM.
It looks like some utilities were not available on the MacOS, so I guess
I wrote this code myself.

Some of you might remember what [WAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_WAD)
files were. I hope most of you at least know about [DOOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)), the first popular "first-person" game invented. Some of my fondest memories are playing
this game with my brothers.

By the way, the "kumac" file is for [PAW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_Analysis_Workstation). PAW was a great application used by
high-energy physicists for plotting
that predates tools like R. The drawback? You wrote macros in FORTRAN.

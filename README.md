# DUIT

I found this code base on my computer, but I actually don't remember
writing it. I do remember designing my own game levels for DOOM.
It looks like some utilities were not available on the MacOS, so I guess
I wrote this code myself.

The files are dated October 1996. I think I used 
[CodeWarrior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeWarrior) for development
on the Mac back then. Note that the STL was not widely available
at the time, which is why I wrote my own List class. I am not even
sure how good CodeWarrior's support of templates was at that point.

Some of the comments are pretty amusing. For example:
```
    /* I really think c++ stinks. About as robust as a house of cards. */
```
Back then c++ was really shaky. Things are much different now.

Some of you might remember what [WAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_WAD)
files were. I hope most of you at least know about [DOOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)), the first popular "first-person" game invented. Some of my fondest memories are playing
this game with my brothers.

By the way, the "kumac" file is for [PAW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_Analysis_Workstation). PAW was a great application used by
high-energy physicists for plotting
that predates tools like R. The drawback? You wrote macros in FORTRAN.
